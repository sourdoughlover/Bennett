Henry is best known for his&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wives_of_Henry_VIII">six marriages</a>, and his efforts to have his first marriage (to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>) annulled. His disagreement with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII">Pope Clement VII</a>&nbsp;about such an annulment led Henry to initiate the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation">English Reformation</a>, separating the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England">Church of England</a>&nbsp;from papal authority.

He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolsey">Thomas Wolsey</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More">Thomas More</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell">Thomas Cromwell</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>&nbsp;all figured prominently in his administration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Henry was an extravagant spender, using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation_Parliament">Reformation Parliament</a>. He converted the money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue. Despite the money from these sources, he was often on the verge of financial ruin due to personal extravagance as well as costly and largely unproductive wars, particularly with King&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I_of_France">Francis I of France</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor_Charles_V">Holy Roman Emperor Charles V</a>, King&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V_of_Scotland">James V of Scotland</a>&nbsp;and the Scottish regency under the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hamilton,_Duke_of_Ch%C3%A2tellerault">Earl of Arran</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Guise">Mary of Guise</a>.

He has been described as "one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne" and his reign described as the "most important" in English history.[1][2] He was an author and composer. As he aged, he became severely overweight and his health suffered. He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful, egotistical, paranoid and tyrannical monarch.[3] He was succeeded by his son&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VI">Edward VI</a>.</p>
